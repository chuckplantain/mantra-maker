# mantra-maker
how hard can it be to produce mantras (just for fun)?
Anything to promote self improvement is a good thing.

By using a random mantra for a two time per day session. One will eventually
stick or else, a random one is as good as any other.
Currently, the technology is primitive, but, by using python libraries. Maybe
I can fine-tune it. What am I saying?

This thing produces a mantra. AUM.
